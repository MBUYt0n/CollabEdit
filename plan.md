Your workflow is solid for a **real-time collaborative editing application**, but I have a few suggestions to improve efficiency, scalability, and performance. Let's refine your approach:

## **Improved Workflow for Collaborative Editing**
1. **WebSockets for Real-Time Edits**  
   - Users connect to the **WebSocket server** to send and receive real-time updates.  
   
2. **Kafka for Pub/Sub Communication**  
   - Each **document has its own Kafka topic**.  
   - Users **publish changes** to the topic.  
   - Kafka **broadcasts edits to all subscribed users** working on the document.  

3. **Optimize Data Transmission (Line-Based Edits )**  
   - Instead of publishing the **entire document**, **only the changed line(s) or text range** is sent.  
   - This minimizes bandwidth usage and improves real-time responsiveness.  
   
4. **Server Applies & Broadcasts Changes**  
   - Server **validates the change**, updates the in-memory state, and then **publishes the new state to Kafka**.  
   - Clients receive updates **and apply them locally**.  

5. **Snapshot Storage for Crash Recovery**  
   - Periodically, **store full document snapshots** in a database (e.g., every 10 seconds or after 50 edits).  
   - Use **Redis for fast retrieval** of the latest state before falling back to a database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, or Cassandra).  

6. **State Management & Ordering Guarantees**  
   - Kafka **maintains strict ordering** within a partition (so edits don’t arrive out of sequence).  
   - **Each document edit is stored as an event**, allowing rollback or replay if needed.

## **Key Optimizations to Improve Performance**
 **Use Line-Based or Character-Based Diffing**  
   - Instead of sending full paragraphs or blocks of text, **send only the exact text changes** (e.g., “insert ‘word’ at line 4, position 12”).  
   - Tools like **Operational Transformation (OT)** or **Conflict-Free Replicated Data Types (CRDTs)** can help resolve simultaneous edits.  

 **Reduce Kafka Load with Aggregation**  
   - If edits are coming in **too frequently**, aggregate multiple keystrokes **before publishing** (e.g., batch updates every 100ms).  
   - This reduces Kafka's message load while keeping a smooth real-time experience.  

 **Optimize Storage Strategy**  
   - Store **compressed document diffs** instead of full copies for each edit.  
   - Keep a **separate event log** (like a commit history) that allows users to time-travel through versions.  

 **Implement Client-Side Prediction**  
   - Like Google Docs, **immediately apply local edits** so users don’t experience lag while waiting for server confirmation.  
   - Use Kafka’s ordering to **reconcile conflicting edits** in the background.

## **Final Thoughts: Your Plan is Great with These Tweaks**
- **Kafka is a solid choice** for handling collaboration at scale.  
- **Line-based changes**  will make it **faster and more efficient**.  
- **Snapshot storage + incremental diffs** will help with recovery and version control.  
- **Client-side optimizations (like OT or CRDTs)** will enhance user experience.  

This setup will give you a **fast, scalable, and real-time collaboration system** similar to Google Docs.
